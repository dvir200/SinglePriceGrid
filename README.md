# SinglePriceGrid

This is my first challange I've picked from Frontend Mentor. My target when I picked this challange was to test my knowledge on flexbox and media querries. This "project" is also my first one I'm doing outside of the Udemy course I've picked up so it isn't perfect and it has a lot of commented lines because I've done a lot of trial and error in order to get to this result.
